<p class='c007'>While Horace Greeley and myself were in
conversation over our breakfast at the Graham
House, Goss escorted Fred Douglas and lady
to the table, who took seats near us. I knew
not who they were, nor do I know that
Greeley did, but I think he did. They had
arrived the previous night, and this was my
first knowledge that Goss kept colored boarders,
who politely helped them, and took a seat
beside them, and conversed on their favorite
theme of anti-slavery. I stared at Goss and
Fred and lady and at Greeley, who gave me a
sly glance, and ate his bran mush and molasses
as though nothing unusual was transpiring.
I finished my mush, and retired, and felt that
Goss had perpetrated a gross impropriety.
And although I was then teaching negroes in
the kitchens of New York, amid slush and
kettles and frying pans, and thus evinced my
warm desire to elevate the whole African race,
yet my feelings were so grossly outraged by
this unnatural and disgusting amalgamation,
that I went to Major Mordecah M. Noah, (who
published a daily evening paper,) and told him
the whole story, who opened a tremendous
broadside on Greeley, who dared Noah to reveal
the name of his informant, although he
knew I must be the man. I besought Noah
not to disclose my name, as I did not desire
to have a controversy with Greeley about
Graham bread and Africans. Noah promised
he would not, but he discharged such caustic
and unceasing broadsides, and poked so much
fun at Greeley, for breakfasting with negroes,
that he again ferociously demanded Noah to
disclose the name of his cowardly informant.
I again implored Noah to stand firmly, and
not to divulge my name. Noah said that he
did not see how he could avoid it, as Greeley
had made such a savage demand. But I induced
him, after long and plaintive importunity,
not to expose me, and Noah soon withdrew
his forces from Africa, and attacked
Greeley on his native hills of America, on the
subject of the Tariff and other themes. And
in their deluge of words and detraction, I did
not molest Noah, nor any of his descendants,
save to pawn some of my traps occasionally to
pay Goss my weekly board. Greeley snarled
and growled at me for weeks, but he had a
conciliatory nature, and magnanimously forgave
me, and, (as after the quarrels of two
enthusiastic lovers,) we were better friends
than ever. I admired the humor and genial
nature of Major Noah, and I respected the
transcendental talents of Horace Greeley, but
I did not wish to be devoured by their gladiatorial
collisions, although I was the sole origin
of their editorial combat. Rhode Island was
now on the verge of civil war. My father
addressed the first assemblage at the old Town
House, in Providence, against the revolutionary
doctrines of Thomas Wilson Dorr, and
harangued the friend’s of Law and Order in
various parts of the State. My brother Henry
came to New York, and told me that my
father had received letters from the insurgents,
warning him to prepare to meet his
God, and was insulted by ruffians while crossing
Providence bridge, who threatened to destroy
his property, if he did not cease his inflammatory
speeches against them, and that
father defied them, and told them that they
might burn his houses, but they could not
burn his land. I went to Providence, and was
saluted by father in tones of the purest affection.
I slept at his house, for several nights,
and joined the City Guards, and my company
was assigned a position on the west side of the
bridge, to guard the city from sunset till sunrise.
News came that old General Green’s
Kentish Guards, (cherished by Washington,)
of East Greenwich, commanded by Captain
Allen, had fired on the insurgents at Pawtucket,
five miles from Providence, and killed
and wounded half a dozen of the rebels, and
my Company was immediately sent to relieve
the Kentish Guards. Just prior to entering
Pawtucket, the Dorr women belched from
their doors and windows the most disgusting
ejaculations, and I heard one virago exclaim:
“An’t you a precious gang of soldiers? You
look as though Providence had taken a powerful
emetic.” This was a hard dose, but it
came from one who bore the form and garb
of a lady, and we had to swallow it without a
murmur. Ex-Governor Earle came from
Pawtucket on the wings of lightning, and told
us it would be instant death for us to enter
Pawtucket without more men, but, much to
my regret, our Captain ordered us to follow
him into the town, whose streets were crowded
with desperate outlaws, who were hooting
and hurling stones and fragments of iron at
the Kentish Guards, who were literally surrounded
by the mob. When Captain Allen
saw our Company approach, he instantly arrayed
us against the insurgents for fatal action,
and, taking out his watch, told the beligerent
thousands present, that if they did not disperse
in ten minutes, he would fire upon them.
I suffered more in these ten minutes, than in
all my life, because I feared the rascals
wouldn’t go, and we would have to fire at
them.  I had the dyspepsia most horribly,
and had all my pockets stuffed with chunks
of Graham bread, for a warrior’s rations, and
was reduced to an utter skeleton, and could
hardly hold my heavy musket perpendicularly,
and my bones fairly rattled when the bloody
words of Captain Allen fell upon my ears.
I had never fired a gun but once, and that
was at a snake at Topsfield, Massachusetts,
and although the muzzle was within an inch
of his head, the ball passed into the ground,
and the snake fled before I could reload my
gun. And yet I feared I might shed human
blood, and perhaps kill one or more, if Captain
Allen ordered my Company to fire at the
Dorrites.  And I was very sure I would
fall like a dead man, from the effect upon my
dyspeptic nerves of fright and thundering
noise caused by the simultaneous discharge of
one hundred muskets. And I actually envied
the rebels who could escape from peril,
while I could not, as I had a gun, cap and
knapsack, and was hemmed in by my comrades.
I could not exchange my clothes, and
was closely watched by the insurgents, and if
I left the ranks, I might be shot by my own
companions in arms, and if I escaped their
fire, the insurgents themselves might instantly
dispatch me. The fatal ten minutes had nearly
expired, and I supposed my time had come,
as I felt sure if we fired, that two thousand
ruffians would rush upon us, and hack us to
bleeding fragments. I looked up to the brilliant
stars, but with all their cheerfulness and
fascination, I feared to have my soul approach
their glittering realms. I looked down upon
the green earth, and I desired not an eternal
abode for my butchered carcase below its
fragrant surface. To kill a man I thought
would be horrible, and forever cause unpleasant
dreams. But to be killed myself, by the
enemy, seemed still more horrible. And I
resolved to put nothing but powder in my
gun, so that I could not kill or wound the
Dorrites. I regretted that I could not slyly
tell them of my humane resolves, so that they
could evince similar clemency towards me,
when we came together hand to hand, and
foot to foot, and nails to nails, and nose to
nose, and belly to belly, and teeth to teeth.
The ten minutes elapsed, and the rebels remained
and yelled and stoned and defied us.
Captain Allen passed along the line, and told
us we had got bloody work before us, and besought
us to be firm, and reload our muskets
quickly, and fire at the hearts of our adversaries,
and we would conquer them, although
they numbered thousands, and we only hundreds.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>I came near falling at this intelligence,
and leaned very heavily against the soldiers
on either side of me, who threatened to shoot
me if I didn’t stand straighter, which straightened
me mighty quick. Captain Allen spoke
of American patriotism, and our duty to our
native State, and to the United States, and of
the valor of Green and Perry, but I scarcely
heard what he said, as my terrified mind was
contemplating the horrors of an instant and
bloody doom, and my gloomy prospects beyond
the grave. Captain Allen takes out his
watch, and draws his sword, and I look towards
Heaven, and engage in a most solemn
silent prayer, as I now expect to die in about
five minutes.</p>

    <div>HALF AN HOUR BEFORE DAYLIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Well, Jack, where are all the boys
you promised me?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—They are asleep in the market.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Zounds! Jack! Arouse them, or we
are lost.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—They have one eye open, and the
gilded stuff will soon open the other.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Jack, what do you mean? Have I
not kept open house for three days and nights,
and swilled yourself and comrades with liquor
for a week, and haven’t you all been drunk at
my expense for several days? By Jupiter!
Jack! you won’t desert me, after drinking so
much of my best rum, will you?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—The boys won’t expose their eyes and
nose, and teeth and skulls, and bellies to the
sharp claws and big fists, and stones and clubs
of your political adversaries, without some
money in advance, to tickle the palms of the
surgeon and nurses at the Hospital. For doctors
and nurses won’t trust the poor, you
know, and especially the boys who get their
skulls cracked at the primary elections.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Well, Jack, tell the boys that I will
fill them with good rum until the primary
election is over, and then, if I am victorious in
the Nominating Convention, I’ll reward them
liberally with money.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—(With his fingers whirling like a
windmill over his nose)—The boys an’t so
green as to trust the politicians until they have
fought their bloody sieges, and elected them
to offices where they can steal fortunes from
the people, including many a chunk of choice
grub from our own mouths. No, no, Peter.
It won’t do. Down with the cash, and all
will go well.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Have I not often got yourself and
friends out of the Watch House?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—And have we not long bought your
grog, although you adulterated it more than
other liquor dealers? And have we not fought
your public battles, and exposed ourselves to
imprisonment, and periled our lives to give
you political influence to liberate us from the
Watch House, when we got into a bad scrape
on your account?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—You lie, you thief and drunken vagabond,
if you say I adulterated my liquor more
than other rum sellers.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—Have a care, Peter, have a care, for
did I not catch you in the very act of pouring
water by the pailfull into a rum hogshead last
week, that was only about half full of spurious
alcohol, when you began to adulterate it?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—I was afraid the boys would drink
so much, that they would not be sober enough
to whip my political enemies to-day, if I did
not adulterate my pure and strong rum, which
came from Jamaica only last week.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—That will do, Peter—that will do, for
you always could tell a smoother and bigger
lie than me, and I give it up.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Come, come, Jack—this won’t do.
The sun will soon be climbing the eastern hills,
and there’s no time to be lost. What’s to be
done?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—Fork over, Peter, and we’ll die, if
necessary, in our effort to stuff the ballot
boxes, and keep them stuffed all day, and drive
your foes from the polls, and seize the boxes
at sunset, and count the votes in favor of your
delegates to the Convention.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Will you be true?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—As money to the poor man.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—Then awake the boys, and let them
all come quickly, and get some stuff.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i> (Scampers to the market)—Get up,
you lazy drunken thieves, and run for your
lives to Peter Cooper’s, and get some precious
stuff. (They all spring from the butcher
stalls, and run like bloodhounds for Peter’s
groggery.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—Here we are, Peter.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—So I perceive. (They all slyly smile
and wink, and screw their expressive mouths.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—Shall I help the boys to some grog,
Peter, while you are counting out our primary
wages?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—O yes, but don’t give them too stiff a
horn, Jack, as I fear they will all get dead
drunk before sundown, and then I’ll surely be
defeated, as the hardest fighting will be after
the poles are closed. So, boys, please drink
moderately until the election is over, and fight
like bull dogs till the result is declared, and
then, if I am the conqueror, you can all get
drunk on my toddy for a week or month.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—That’s the talk. Them’s our views,
an’t they, boys?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>All</i> (drinking)—Well—they are.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—There, Jack, there’s your share, and
now you divide the balance among your honest
and noble companions.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—Boys—do you hear the compliments
of our candidate?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>All</i>—Well—we do, and he is a man of his
word, and we’ll put him through.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—(Putting all the money in his pocket)—Scissors!
boys! Look down the Bowery!
There come, on the full jump, about forty
bullies with Ned, the murderer, at their head,
screaming and beckoning his bloody gang to
follow him.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—O God! Stand by me, friends, or
I’ll be murdered before the polls open. For
Ned threatened to kill me yesterday, if I didn’t
withdraw my name as a candidate. So, don’t
let him and his desperate band murder me.
For I’m sure they will, if you abandon me.
O dear! Do stand by me, brave young gentlemen!
Won’t you? Please do? (He begins
to cry.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—Here they come, and they are armed
with clubs, knives and pistols.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—O Lordy! (And he crawls under
the counter, and gets behind a rum cask, and
is as quiet as a young rat.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ned</i> (bursting through the door, and his
cronies smashing the windows)—I understand
you stuffed the ballot-box last night for Peter
Cooper, and intend to carry the election to-day,
by spurious ballots already deposited.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Jack</i>—You are a liar. (They close, and
Ned throws Jack, and mauls him awfully.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ned</i>—Go in, boys, and give no quarter,
and drag Peter Cooper from behind the rum
cask, under the bar, and give him a dreadful
flogging, for not withdrawing in favor of my
candidate.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—O spare me, Ned, spare me, and I’ll
withdraw from the field.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ned</i>—Shut up, Snarlyow. Give it to him,
boys, and knock his teeth down his throat,
and make his nose as red as his crimes, and
his eyes as black as his heart. Hit him again,
and avenge his robbery of his poor old Aunt.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—O spare me, kind gentlemen, and I’ll
give you all the rum I’ve got in the bar, and
down cellar, too.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ned</i>—Close your jaws, Shylock. Your time
is come. (Jack now rallies, and a bloody collision
ensues, and two are stabbed, and one
shot, and Peter is terribly beaten, and thrown
into the cellar, but soon crawls up stairs, and
Peter’s friends fly for their lives.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Peter</i>—(sitting on a rum cask, with his nostrils
blocked with coagulated blood, and his
face mashed to a jelly, and Ned and his bullies
drinking, laughing, singing, and dancing)—O
dear me, I wish somebody would come and
relieve me from the clutches of these awful
men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Ned</i>—(throwing a glass of rum in the face
of Peter)—No impudence, Peter. Another
insolent word, and I’ll skin you. (The Police
now rush in, and, after a bloody struggle, arrest
Ned and all his followers, and drag them
to prison.)</p>

  <h2 id='fossil' class='c006'>A Precious Fossil.<br /> <br /> <span class='large'><i>Mayor Tiemann’s trickery and treachery to<br /> the Americans thoroughly exposed.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The following <span class='sc'>Card</span> was placed in every
house and store and workshop in 1843, by
direction of Daniel F. Tiemann, and was published
in all the newspapers of that memorable
period:</p>

<p class='c014'>“TO THE VOTERS IN THIS HOUSE.</p>

<p class='c014'>The inclosed Ticket is presented by the
American Republican Party, for your suffrage—it
is composed exclusively of Americans
who have withdrawn from the great contending
parties of the day, for the sake of the
country and its institutions; their character
and standing in the community is well known
to be unexceptionable and highly honorable;
they have pledged themselves, if elected, to
support and carry out the principles of this
party, which are as follows, viz:—</p>

<p class='c014'>1st. We maintain that the Naturalization
Laws should be so altered as to require of all
Foreigners who may hereafter arrive in this
Country, a residence of twenty-one years, before
granting them the privilege of the Elective
Franchise; but at the same time, we distinctly
declare, that it is not our intention to
interfere with the vested rights of any citizen,
or lay any obstruction in the way of Foreigners
obtaining a livlihood or acquiring property
in this country; but on the contrary,
we would grant them the right to purchase,
hold and transfer property, and to enjoy and
participate in all the benefits of our country,
(except that of voting and holding office,) as
soon as they declare their intentions to become
citizens.</p>

<p class='c014'>2d. We advocate the repeal of the present
Common School Law, and the re-establishment
of the Law, known as the Public School
Law.</p>

<p class='c014'>3d. We maintain that the Bible, without
note or comment, is not sectarian—that it is
the fountain-head of morality and all good
government, and should be used in our Public
Schools as a reading Book.</p>

<p class='c014'>4th. We are opposed to a union of Church
and State in any and every form.</p>

<p class='c014'>5th. We hold that native Americans, only,
should be appointed to office, to legislate, administer,
or execute the Laws of their own
country.</p>

<p class='c014'>These are our principles—if you like them,
we ask your support for the enclosed Ticket.
We believe the time has come when we may,
with truth, exclaim, “Delay is dangerous.”
The above principles aim at <em>existing evils</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>which have grown to such enormity as to
threaten seriously our dearest and most sacred
rights. We have waited long and anxiously
for some movement from among other parties
to check these evils, and we have waited in
vain. The only hope that remains, is for
Americans to organize a new party, to combat
and counteract them. This we have done.
The Presidential question we have nothing to
do with.—We invite you to our Standard: it
is raised in the cause of Civil and Religious
Liberty, and no true American can fight
against it. It is the same Banner that was
raised by Americans in ’76.</p>

<div class='c015'>DANIEL F. TIEMANN, <i>President</i>.</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>J. B. Dennis</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>New York, November 1, 1843.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This will do pretty well for a man whose
father is a Holland Dutchman, and cannot now
speak the American language so as to be easily
understood,—who is appointing the ejected
garroters of European Capitals, to the most lucrative
and honorable positions, while poor and
honest and intelligent Americans (for whom
he professed such boundless love in 1843,)
are haughtily denied the humblest appointments
in his gift,—who has toiled with sleepless
vigilance,—since his recent election as
Mayor by the Americans,—to reinstate the
odious George W. Matsell, and who has, after
an arduous struggle, succeeded in effecting the
reappointment of Captain Leonard, a Canadian,
and of Captain Dowling, an Irishman, (both
of whose naturalization papers I would like to
see, or the man who has seen them,) who
were smuggled back to their old quarters by
Cooper, Gerard, Tiemann, Bowen, and Stranaham,
to cut the throat of Seward, and to diffuse
poison through the Police Department,
and to re-create the perjured carcase of Matsell
on the ruins of Tallmadge and Wm. Curtis
Noyes, his noble son-in-law. Tiemann aspires
to the honors of a Governor, and himself
and his brother Edward Cooper, (the Street
Commissioner, and the own son of Peter
Cooper,) are appointing all the ruffians of
both hemispheres to office, to effect the nomination
and election of Tiemann as Governor
of the Empire State. But Peter, and Daniel,
and Edward will be foiled. No man can attain
the distinguished honors of America, who
prostitutes his own integrity and that of his
fellow citizens, to effect his ungodly designs.
Aaron Burr and other ambitious rogues tried
that experiment, and they were resisted and
foiled by the God who loves and protects our
beloved America, and they went down to
ignominious graves, whose ashes will be loathed
and trampled by a thousand generations.
Mayor Tiemann is a ninny and a hypocrite—has
basely disowned his native Holland skies—has
never been naturalized—bamboozled the
Americans in 1843 and 1857—loves neither
American nor foreigner, nor his God—but
adores himself and Peter Cooper, and fears
George W. Matsell and his Matron Mistress
on Randall’s Island, whom he forced and
nearly strangled, while he committed a deed
of hell, in the violation of her person, for
which, in any city of Europe, he would be
dragged to a dungeon or the block, and perhaps
torn to pieces in the market place, by
the indignant and phrensied populace.</p>

    <div>JOHN KELLY’S HOME.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>Enter John in tears.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>John’s Mother</i>—Well, dear Johnny, why do
you cry so hard? Where on earth did you
come from? Have you been fighting, and did
you act the coward, and get whipped, and run
home? Speak, my darling boy, and speak
quickly, so that your dear mother can sympathise
with you.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—(still crying)—Dear mother, my
heart is so full of woe, that I cannot speak.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—(begins to cry)—O, God! I fear
something awful has happened to my adored
son, and that he is injured internally, and
will soon die. (Falls on her knees, and clasps
her hands, and wails in piteous tones, and
implores God to spare her son.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—(seizing her)—Don’t cry, dear mother,
my heart, not my form, is bruised.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—And who bruised your big heart?
Did a ruffian throw a stone, or kick you, or
strike your heart with his fist? O tell me
quickly, so that I can fell him to the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—Neither, good mother, neither. I
spoke figuratively, when I said my heart was
bruised.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—And an’t figures facts? How
strangely you talk, dear Johnny. Did not
your old mother go to school, and did she not
cipher as far as Distraction? And when you
say your poor heart is bruised figuratively,
you talk from the Rule of Distraction, don’t
you? Mr. Daboll used to say so, before you
was born. Go to, my son, go to, for your old
mother is not so far distracted as not to understand
figures as far as Distraction.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i> (just emerging from a profound nap)—What
is all this row about?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—Some rowdy has bruised Johnny’s
heart.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i>—Where is my hat? I’ll pursue the
rascal.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—Hold, father, hold, and you, mother,
please calm your nerves, and listen to my
brief but plaintive story.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i>—Go on, dear son.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—And we will judge impartially.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—I have left Mr. Bennett.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—Good Lord! For what?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—Because he wanted me to tell lies.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—(falling)—O God! O God! We
are hungry and nearly naked, and may soon
be houseless, but thou hast blessed us with an
honest boy, which is a far more precious boon
than food and raiment and shelter. (And she
utters a long and fervent and grateful prayer to
God, for the unwavering integrity of her beloved
son, while Johnny and his father weep
aloud on their bended knees.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i> (the distracted mother still prostrate
on the floor)—John: Did Mr. Bennett pay you
what he owed you?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—He offered to, but I would not take
it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i>—Why?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—Because I thought he got it dishonestly,
as he wanted me to tell lies.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i>—My landlord was here to-day, and
I told him I expected some money from Mr.
Bennett for your services, and he will be here
this evening, for his rent, and I fear he will
turn us into the street, when I tell him that I
cannot pay him.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—I am very sorry, father, that you
will be cast into the street, on my account.
(The father weeps, and the mother springs to
her feet, and kisses Johnny, and swears that
if the landlord attempts to drive them into the
open air, she will dash his brains out.)</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i> (putting on his hat, and with one hand
on the latch)—Don’t cry, dear father and
mother, nor be excited and unhappy in my
brief absence.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—Where are you going, Johnny?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—I am going round to the fire engine
house, to see a noble young fireman, who is
a warm friend of mine, and whose father is
very rich, and I am sure he will cry when I
tell him that my poor old father and mother
are sick and hungry, and are about to be
thrust into the street.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i> (on the verge of despair)—Tell him
our mournful story, Johnny, but do not beg.
No, my Johnny, for God’s sake, don’t beg.
Let us all die before we implore alms. Your
mother is too proud to have her son descend
to that. Don’t beg, Johnny, don’t beg, I implore
you. It is my last prayer to my dear son.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i>—I could not beg, mother. I would
die before I would thus degrade myself and
noble parents, who have seen fairer days than
these. Besides, my friend is humane, and so
are his parents, and I am sure I will not have
to beg him to relieve us. It will be sufficient
for him to learn of our destitution, and that
we became utterly poor, because I would not
tell lies for James Gordon Bennett.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father</i>—Go, my son, to your young fireman
friend, and tell your story in your own way.
I’m sure you will never degrade your father
and mother, after your refusal to lie for Mr.
Bennett.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mother</i>—Go, Johnny, and soon return to
your distracted parents, and let them know
their fate.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>John</i> (kissing his mother, and warmly pressing
his father’s hand)—Good bye, father and
mother, and I’ll soon bring you pleasing news,
and a deliverance from abject penury. (He
goes.)</p>

    <div><i>Evening—Enter Landlord.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><i>Landlord</i>—Well, Mr. Kelly, have you got
my rent?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mr. Kelly</i>—No, sir. My son has left Mr.
Bennett, because he wanted him to tell lies.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Landlord</i>—For what?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mr. Kelly</i>—Because he wanted him to lie.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Landlord</i>—What a fool your son must be.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mrs. Kelly</i>—Don’t you call my son a fool,
sir. God loved George Washington because
he would not lie, and made him the Liberator
of his country.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Landlord</i>—That’s all gammon. Washington
was an old Federalist, and an old knave
and fool, and could swear and lie as hard as a
delinquent tenant.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Mrs. Kelly</i> (throws the tea pot, full of
scalding water, at his head)—Take that, you
miserable old tory and miser. (The landlord
rushes upon Mrs. Kelly, when Mr. Kelly, forgetting
his rheumatic leg, flies at him like a
tiger, and while they grapple, and level their
deadly blows, with Mrs. Kelly pouring hot
water down the neck and back of the landlord—in
comes John, and his young fireman
friend, who both seize the landlord, and hurl
him down stairs, and kick him into the street,
amid the frantic yells of all the neighbors.
John then introduces the young New York
Fireman to his father and mother, who receive
him with courtesy and fervor.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Whereas, A large number of swine are kept in various portions
of the city; and whereas, it is the general practice of
persons so keeping swine, to boil offal and kitchen refuse and
garbage, whereby a highly offensive and dangerous nuisance
is created, therefore, be it</p>

of Health, deeming swine kept south of (86th) street, in
this city, to be creative of a nuisance and detrimental to the

authorized and directed to take, seize, and remove from
any and all places and premises, all and every swine found or
kept on any premises in any place in the city of New York
southerly of said street, and to cause all such swine to be removed
to the Public Pound, or other suitable place beyond the
limits of the city or northerly of said street, and to cause all
premises or places wherein, or on which, said swine may
have been so found or kept, to be thoroughly cleaned and purified

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
